Included Projects

1.SSH Log Analysis & Security Monitoring

This project analyzes SSH authentication logs to monitor access patterns and detect suspicious activity such as brute-force attempts and unauthorized login behavior.

Key focus areas include:

Authentication success vs failure analysis

Detection of repeated failed login attempts

Identification of targeted usernames (e.g., root)

Source IP analysis for brute-force behavior

Geographic visualization of attack sources

The dashboard provides visibility into SSH authentication health and highlights common attack patterns seen in real SOC environments.

2.Web Traffic Analysis & Security Monitoring

This project focuses on analyzing Apache web server access logs to understand web traffic behavior and identify potential security issues.

Key focus areas include:

Overall web traffic volume analysis

Successful responses vs client and server errors

Detection of abnormal or suspicious URI access patterns

Identification of high-activity client IP addresses

Geographic distribution of web traffic

The analysis helps distinguish between normal user behavior and potentially malicious activity such as scanning, probing, or automated requests.
